        When it comes to food, I’m 
        always on the hunt for new 
        inspirations and ideas. 
        I think the ideal way 
        to learn more about food 
        is by exploring new cuisines and cultures. 
        The world of culinary adventure is open right 
        in front of you. You just need to wear your apron and get started.
        
        My inspiration for this recipe comes from one of our trips to Dubai a few years ago. A magnificent modern city that’ll mesmerize you with its ultra modern architecture. Not to mention the classic Emirati cuisine. Just phenomenal. And the best part? A wonderful day spent with good old friends. I returned back with a big smile and wonderful memories for a lifetime. Truth to be told, I’m a memory keeper.</p>
